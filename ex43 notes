* Map object has the structure for the scenes. It has the information about which 
scenes there are and which room the player is currently in. It also has the 
information about which choice leads to which scene. 
    - self.current_scene keeps track of the current room the player is in
    - next_scene gets the scene and the result of the related choice. Based on that 
    it returns the scene to play next
    - opening_scene sets the atrribute to the scene parameter that is given when 
    the Map object is created
    - a scene has the following information: scene name, and the scenes that can 
    follow from this scene
    - the scenes are represented as a dictionary contaning a list. the key is the 
    scene shortname. the list consists of the scene name and the keys of the scenes 
    that can follow from this scene. The position of the following scenes in the 
    list and the results of the choices in the scenes should be linked.    

* Scene object contains the information about the scenes. It has the description
text and the choices that are used in a scene. It will get the result of the choice 
from the player and gives the result of a choice to the Engine object.
    - enter will show the description of the scene and will call choice.
    - choice will will present choices to the player, get the input and then return 
    the result to the Engine object.

* Engine object uses the Map object to look up which scene to play next. It takes 
the result from a Scene object and uses that with the Map object to decide which 
scene to play next.
    - play uses the Map object to get the scene that needs to be played. it then 
    calls the Scene object to be played. it recieves the result (choice) of the 
    scene aand uses that to get the next scene to be played.
    - when an Scene object returns 'end' the engine quits the program.
