The interface will present text as output on a terminal. This will include 
clear screen when nescecary. The output will start in the top left of the 
screen. Other programs can send text to the interface and the interface will 
take care of formatting and text position.
These programs do have to use newline etc characters in the text to create 
paragraphs. 
When a program has to output text it will call the interface. 
The interface will make sure the text will fit correctly on the screen.

Text will be delivered as triple-quoted strings. These will all be taken from 
a single module. 

The interface will parse the text. The text will be cut into smaller strings which
wil be a given length. This length will be a variable that can be set. The text 
can contain newlines and these will be used accordingly.
